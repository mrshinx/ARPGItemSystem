# ARPG Item System Mod for Terraria
[Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3022738051)
## What this mod does

This mod completely overhauls the item prefix system that vanilla Terraria has, making it to be more like in modern ARPG games. 

## Features

- Items can no longer be reforged by the Goblin Tinkerer and receive vanilla prefixes. They instead are able to roll prefixes (green bonuses) and suffixes (blue bonuses) according to their item type.
- A weapon will be able to have maximum 6 modifiers, including 3 prefixes and 3 suffixes.
- An armor will be able to have maximum 4 modifiers, including 2 prefixes and 2 suffixes.
- An accessory will be able to have maximum 2 modifiers, including 1 prefixes and 1 suffixes.
- The amount and tier of modifiers you can roll will increase as you progress through the game. In the beginning you will only be able to roll 1 prefix and 1 suffix with a weapon.
- HIGHLY COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER MODDED CONTENT. Modded items are able to utilize this system.
