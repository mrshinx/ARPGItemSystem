Major update: Accessory modifier
Accessory can now roll modifier up to a maximum of 1 prefix and 1 suffix.
With this update, all weapons, armors and accessories can now roll modifier.

I will now move on to develop other RPG modules and will revisit this mod once I have learned how to create UI elements.
If the RPG modules ever come out, this mod will receive new special fitting modifiers such as chance to inflict DoT, debuff, mana shield, on-hit effect, etc... and even cursed modifiers that only drop from bosses.
Hopefully I won't fail miserably and end up giving up on modding.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARPG Item System is a mod that aims to completely replace the modifier system of vanilla Terraria with the popular ARPG item system.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A weapon will be able to have maximum 6 modifiers, including 3 prefixes and 3 suffixes.
An armor will be able to have maximum 4 modifiers, including 2 prefixes and 2 suffixes.
An accessory will be able to have maximum 2 modifiers, including 1 prefixes and 1 suffixes.

The amount and tier of modifiers you can roll will increase as you progress through the game. In the beginning you will only be able to roll 1 prefix and 1 suffix.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Items can no longer be reforged or put into Goblin Tinkerer's reforge slot.
In order to reroll your item, use the "craft" keybind while holding said item. For now, you only need to pay the buying value of the item. This will change in later updates.

This mod is supposed to complement my upcoming RPG mod (not yet started). As this is my first ever mod, update will come very slowly as I learn how to mod better.
Since this mod is a pure power up to player, I'd recommend playing it with difficulty mods like my latest mod: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3027691283] ARPG Enemy System [/url]
Multiplayer should work.
Have fun.
